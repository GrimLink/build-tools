# Grunt

Grunt setup with Webpack for JS bundeling.

I personlay moved to Gulp and/or Webpack.
So I am not using Grunt that much any more.

Still this setup rocks!
Since it builds the CSS just the way I want it.
And JS via the power of webpack.

I was planing to also add an Uglify option so you don't need the Webpack.
But I am not planing to add this anymore.
