# Gulp

**Site:** https://gulpjs.com/

Pretty much an port of Grunt but with more flexibility.

I kept the tasks clean and simple.
Compared to many Gulp configs I have seen.
That just lost logic ðŸ˜¨

I my current preferred build tool.

Just as Grunt it uses the power of Webpack for the JS.
But I am planning to add an uglify option.
Just because I want to see that option work as well.
