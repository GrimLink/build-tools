# Parcel

**Site:** https://parceljs.org/

Sample setup using parcel.

Usefull for quick setups.
Since it is zero config.

Funny enough this not completely true.
There are many config for other packages found in a parcel project.
E.g. `postcss.config.js`, `.babelrc` and `.sassrc`.

But if you keep things simple you probably don't need this.

I personally do need these configs for my build tools.
So parcel is not my choice when to pick a build tool.
